/**
 * Raw queries on actual element's webelement
 * 'Raw' means - without any waiting...
 *
 * All are implemented through element.getWebElement()
 * e.g. element.getWebElement().getText over element.text()
 * because element.text() already has waiting built in.
 * this is needed, because these queries are used not only to build corresponding element methods
 * with waiting built in
 * but also for conditions...
 *
 * Hence, these functions are not supposed to be used in "perform/get" context:
 *   `element.click().then(query.text)`
 * this query may fail if element was absent after click for some milliseconds...
 * use the following alternative instead:
 *   `element.click().then(get.text)`
 *
 * Here, queries do not contain has* and is* queries, like hasText, or isVisible.
 * User can use has* and is* conditions instead. Example:
 *   `if (element.matches(has.text('foo'))) { ... }
 * We really don't need such has* or is* queries both here and built in the entity itself
 * (like element.isVisible), because their use case is very rare. The user will mainly use
 * steps (entity commands, like click) and assertions (entity should(condition)) in tests.
 * And SelenideJs is a tests tool, not something else.
